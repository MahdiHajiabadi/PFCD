Probabilistic Feature based Community Detection via a Graphical Model Approach

Detection of hidden community structures could be considered as one of the fundamental tasks in analyzing and
summarizing the large scale social networks. Even though a wide variety of techniques for community detection are proposed, most of
them are based on the network connectivity structures exclusively. There exist much accessible information on network nodes including
gender types in social networks, feeding behavior in ecological networks, and location information on e-trading networks that can be
aligned with the network structure to attain more reliable and efficient extraction of communities. Here, we propose a novel probabilistic
graphical model to consider both of the network structure and these node “features”. We construct a generative approach to recognize
the efficient features on the formation of the network structures and detect the appropriate features dependent on each community.
Furthermore, the learned model can be applied to infer the main consisting features on the formation of the large scale behavior of the
network and their effects on communities. Unlike most of the earlier ad-hoc procedures, our approach learns the relevant features to
the community structures through a probabilistic vein. The experimental results based on well-known real networks and simulated ones
verify the superiority of the proposed generative approach as compared to the earlier ones
